# ## Problem 3:  green-screening!
# 
# This question asks you to write one function that takes in two images:
#  + orig_image  (the green-screened image)
#  + new_bg_image (the new background image)
#  
# It also takes in a 2-tuple (corner = (0,0)) to indicate where to place the upper-left
#   corner of orig_image relative to new_bg_image
#
# The challenge is to overlay the images -- but only the non-green pixels of
#   orig_image...
#

#
# Again, you'll want to borrow from hw7pr1 for
#  + opening the files
#  + reading the pixels
#  + create some helper functions
#    + defining whether a pixel is green is the key helper function to write!
#  + then, creating an output image (start with a copy of new_bg_image!)
#
# Happy green-screening, everyone! Include at least TWO examples of a background!
#





# Here is a signature for the green-screening...
# remember - you will want helper functions!
def green_screen( orig_image, new_bg_image, corner=(0,0) ):
    """ be sure to include a better docstring here! """
    pass
